EGit is an Eclipse Team provider for <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>.
Git is a distributed SCM, which means every developer has a full copy of all 
history of every revision of the code, making queries against the history 
very fast and versatile. The EGit project is implementing Eclipse tooling 
for the <a href="/jgit/">JGit</a> Java implementation of Git.
